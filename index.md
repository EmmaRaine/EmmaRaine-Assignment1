## Hello and welcome to my online portfolio. 

I am Emma Raine, a 21 year-old postgraduate student from West Yorkshire. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Liverpool, obtaining a BSc in [Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/), where I developed a particular interest in population change and health alongside natural hazards and climatology. I am currently studying at the University of Leeds for an MSc in [Geographical Information Systems](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/courses/7411/geographical-information-systems-msc), focusing on a variey of human and environmental topics. 

Throughout my undergraduate studies I was able to develop a basic understanding of Geographical Information Systems - *GIS* **(in particular ArcGIS Pro and QGIS)**, undertaking a variety of spatial analysis using tools and functions within the applications. Alongside this, I developed skills across numerous statistical programmes **(R, Minitab, SPSS)**, and continue to develop my understanding of these at postgraduate levels. Postgraduate studies have allowed me to further my knowledge of GIS, underpinned by a more comprehensive understanding of spatial data and spatial analysis, while I have also developed my programming skills to a level I would not previously thought I could understand. 

My online portfolio presents me with an opportunity to share my postgraduate work, highlighting the skills I have developed. While my portfolio currently only includes links to work undertaken in my postgraduate programming module, in the future it will hopefully contain links to other postgraduate work.

## MSc Geographical Information Systems

Starting in September 2020, I began studying to obtain a master's degree, hoping in the future this will provide me with essential knowledge for a role in planning or environmental impact assessment. During this year-long course, I will be required to undertake 7 modules, accounting for 180 credits. 
These modules include:
* GIS and Data Visualisation (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=201718&M=GEOG-5032M))
* Professional and Personal Development (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5022M))
* Geodemographics and Neighbourhood Analysis (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5255M))
* Applied GIS and Retail Modelling (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5937M))
* GIS and Environment (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5060M))
* Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5990M))
* Dissertation - *on a topic of my choosing* (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5160M))

## Programming for Geographical Information Systems - Assignment 1

As part of this module, the first assignment required me to create an agent-based model to represent the movement and food consumption of sheep within an environment. 
The model was created the in Spyder application and was tested, generally using the print() function. For easy manipulation of the model, some of the variables can be altered by changing the number to which they are assigned. This creates a flexible model that can represent different sheep behaviours. 

This code should run continually as an animation until a stopping condition, which suggests the sheep's stores are full, is met. This animation can be viewed in a graphical user interface (GUI) by using the menu to select 'run model'.

The repository that contains the code for these models can be viewed [here](https://github.com/EmmaRaine/PracticalPortfolio)
