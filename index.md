### Hello and welcome to my online portfolio. 

I am Emma Raine, a 21 year-old postgraduate student from West Yorkshire. I am currently studying at the University of Leeds for an MSc in [Geographical Information Systems](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/courses/7411/geographical-information-systems-msc), focusing on a vast array of topics. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Liverpool, obtaining a BSc in [Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/), where I developed a particular interest in population change and health alongside natural hazards and climatology. 

Throughout my undergraduate and now my postgraduate education I have become a competent user of GIS **(in particular ArcGIS Pro and QGIS)** and numerous statistical programes **(R, Minitab, SPSS)**. Alongside this, I am continuing to develop my knowledge of programming in my postgraduate degree, aiming to ultimately produce a final project planning the location of drunken persons movement.

### MSc Geographical Information Systems

Starting in September 2020, I began studying to obtain a master's degree, hoping in the future this will provide me with essential knowledge for a role in planning or environmental impact assessment. During this year-long course, I will be required to undertake 7 modules, accounting for 180 credits. 
These modules include:
* GIS and Data Visualisation (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=201718&M=GEOG-5032M))
* Professional and Personal Development (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5022M))
* Geodemographics and Neighbourhood Analysis (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5255M))
* Applied GIS and Retail Modelling (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5937M))
* GIS and Environment (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5060M))
* Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5990M))
* Dissertation - *on a topic of my choosing* (click [here](http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=202021&F=P&M=GEOG-5160M))

## Programming for Geographical Information Systems - Assignment 1

As part of this module, the first assignment required me to create an agent-based model. This model was created to represent the movement and eating of sheep within an environment, also modelling these sheep sharing their food stores with other sheep, depending on proximity. 
The model was created using python programming language in Spyder and was extensively tested, generally using the print() function. For easy manipulation of the model, some of the variables can be altered by changing the number to which they are assigned. This creates a flexible model that can represent different sheep behaviours. 

These variables include:

* **num_of_agents**: the number of sheep within the environment
* **num_of_iterations**: how many times sheep are able to be moved
* **neighbourhood**: the distance between the sheep before they start sharing their food stores

This code will continually as an animation until a stopping condition, which suggests the sheeps stores are full, is met. This animation can be viewed in a graphical user interface (GUI) by using the menu to select 'run model'.

The repository that contains the pythonic code for these models can be viewed [here](https://github.com/EmmaRaine/PracticalPortfolio)
