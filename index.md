### Hello and welcome to my online portfolio. 

I am Emma Raine, a 21 year-old postgraduate student from the University of Leeds. I am currently studying for an MSc in [Geographical Information Systems](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/courses/7411/geographical-information-systems-msc), focusing on a vast array of topics. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Liverpool, obtaining a BSc in [Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/), where I developed a particular interest in natural hazards, particularly flooding, population change and health as well as climatology. I have since developed my GIS and programming skills at the University of Leeds.
