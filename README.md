# Online Portfolio

This repository contains the index markdown file which outlines the content for my online portfolio.

This includes some background to my academic life, outlining skills I have developed throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. This also provides a 
more in-depth overview of the modules I will undertake during my MSc GIS course.

It also contains some information on the agent-based modelling assignment for the programming module.
